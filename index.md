# Object Detection with Machine Learning on Raspberry Pi
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
For my first milestone, I first setup the camera, or the hardware for this project. I connected the camera using the application libcamera-hello. When inputting this code onto the terminal, the camera opened on the monitor, indicating that the camera was working and was capturing photos using the Raspberry Pi. Next, I set up OpenCV, or the software of this project. I set up OpenCV, and it displayed a still image saved as a jpg on the monitor, which showed that it was successfully running on python. Although the camera and OpenCV worked individually, when combining them together to complete the setup, they did not successfully capture an image. To solve this problem, I changed the configuration file of the raspberry pi by adding the function, "startx=1" and "gpu_mem=128" and also removed the function "camera_auto_detect=1" by making it a comment.
